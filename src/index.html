            <p>
                The HostelWorld Tech Radar is a tool for visualizing our technology choices. Each technology is given an assessment result, called ring assignment. The four rings are as follows:
              </p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies with a usage culture in our Hostelworld production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used. Often the ‘default’ choice. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; 
              Technologies that passed through ‘access’ and we’ve decided to trial in a real world scenario, I.E production. This is often the first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky. At this stage full on adoption is not guaranteed.
            </li>
            <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; 
              Technologies that are promising and have potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. At this stage we will often uncovered dependencies including up skilling and resourcing requirements and can impact adoption. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; 
              Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.
            </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The Tech Radar is a tool to inform and support technology teams at HostelWorld to pick the best technologies for new projects. It provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the work of ThoughtWorks, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development — changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and consider using in their projects.
              </p>
            
            <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>
            
            <p>
                The Tech Radar is facilitated by the HostelWorld Architecture Team with input from the leads across Technology teams. We endeavour to meet up quarterly to update and publish the latest changes.
